Nighty Relief Application

Nighty Relief is a ScalaFX-based application designed to streamline aid distribution and support sustainable agriculture, aligning with United Nations SDG Goal 2: Zero Hunger. The platform connects recipients, farmers, donors, supervisors, and administrators in a secure and transparent ecosystem to ensure aid reaches those who need it most.

🌍 Background

Food insecurity has risen in Malaysia following the COVID-19 pandemic, with families struggling due to stagnant incomes and rising food prices. Farmers face additional pressure from modernization gaps. Inspired by Pakistan’s Ehsaas Program (2019–2023), Nighty Relief expands the concept by adding:

Direct donor contributions

Integrated farmer support (grants, aid requests)

Supervisor-level oversight for rural coordination

Secure, role-based digital management of aid and users

📝 Personal Reflection

Building this project taught me persistence, problem-solving, and the importance of solid software fundamentals. Applying OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and generics allowed me to create maintainable and scalable code. Challenges such as ScalaFX handling, database integration, and chart visualization were overcome through practice, research, and iteration.
